	Welcome to Elysian
	</div>
	
	Elysium, also called Elysian Fields or Elysian Plain, in Greek mythology, originally the paradise to which heroes on whom the gods 
	conferred immortality were sent. It probably was retained from Minoan religion. In Homerâ€™s writings the Elysian Plain was a land of 
	perfect happiness at the end of the Earth, on the banks of the Oceanus. A similar description was given by Hesiod of the Isles 
	of the Blessed. In the earlier authors, only those specially favoured by the gods entered Elysium and were made immortal. 
	By the time of Hesiod, however, Elysium was a place for the blessed dead, and, from Pindar on, entrance was gained by a righteous life.
